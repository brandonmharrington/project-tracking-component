## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS for mobile nav bar toggle

### What I learned

This project was fairly straightfoward but provided a challenge in creating a background image in a certain shape. I was able to take care of this using a :before selector on the body tag in CSS. This was also the first project I completed where I created a mobile nav bar toggle.

### Continued development

Upon completion of this project, I will continue to work on my CSS skills, positions elements on the page depending on page size, and creating mobile-first designs.
